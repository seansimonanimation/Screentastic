CHANGE LOG!!!
*************

v0.1.0
------
Initial release!

known bugs:
1) Links appear all on the same line, for some reason.

v0.2.1
------
changes:
--All links now have exactly one line break after them.
--Added parantheticals. par>> activates.
--general maintainence stuffs
--started adding infrastructure for future features.

known bugs:
--text starts immediately at the top of the #page element, and looks ugly. DE-UGLIFY!


v0.2.7
------
Changes:
--Formatted the #page element to look like an 8.5x11 page!
--Added fun little 3 hole punches on the left side!

known bugs:
--The Three hole punch uses a unicode character, which does not exist in either Courier Prime or Twine. Need to change to something that renders properly or fix it so that it does.
--There's no error catching for when a passage extends beyond the #page element. Need to add either a scroll bar in the page or seperate out pages. Scroll bar is the lazy fix, multiple page fix is the smart option (smart for printing later).

v0.2.8
------
Changes:
--Added a menu! There's nothing in it yet, but it exists! Woo!
	--Planned items for menu: Quicksave/load, save to PDF, print. (others, too? There's plenty of room...)

Known bugs: 
--Dropping the menu and simultaneously dropping the #page div destroys the passage data. Gotta find out why... For now, the menu just covers the passage.
--Passage text shows through the window... it should go under (fix with z-index).
--Same bugs from last time.

v0.2.9/a/b/c
------------
Changes:
--Added the icons for the menu. They don't work right now and all they do is throw up an alert, telling you that the functionality's not in yet.
--Fixed the spacing on scene headers.
--Fixed the hole punches. They display correctly in the Twine player now.

Known bugs:
-- Still no fix for the text breaking the bottom of the page. For now, just make extra passages as a workaround. I hope to have this fixed for 0.3.0.
--I need to do something about those massive menu icons. They hurt to look at right now.

Thoughts:
--I should put in visual themes. That'd be fun. As long as what's on the page isn't changed, we can do whatever!
--base64 is wonderful.

v0.3.0
------
Changes:
Added a bunch of new features
	automatic page parsing: If your story's passage runs beyond a page, don't worry... Screentastic will automatically add pages as needed.
	Sketch Mode: An exciting new feature that allows you to quickly get your ideas out there.
	The Menu: The menu items are not functional yet, but we've now got a menu that you can open/close at will.
	a bunch of changes under the hood: A lot of the passage handling passage.js has been restructured.
	Automatic scrolling to the top: Screentastic now drops you off at the top of the page whenever you click a link.

known issues:
	The page parser's spacing for adding new pages is not always consistent.
	The links in the menu don't work. Don't worry, they just haven't been programmed yet. They should be done save for the PDF items by 0.4.0.

v0.4.0
------
Changes:
It's been a long time coming, but I've added PDF generation for both Production Mode as well as Sketch Mode!

known issues:
	Generating a PDF doesn't work inside Twine. Only inside browsers.
	Sketch mode is pretty spotty on where and when it wants to include unordered list dots. (Might warrant a recode).
	Page margins between pages still needs work.

v0.5.0
------
Changes
	Back button works.
	Forward button works.
	Quicksave works.
	Quickload works.
	We have hotkeys!
		hotkey list:
			ctrl+left: Back
			ctrl+right: Forward
			ctrl+down: Quicksave
			ctrl+up: Quickload
			ctrl+alt+O: Create and open PDF document
			ctrl+alt+P: Create and print PDF Document (experimental)
