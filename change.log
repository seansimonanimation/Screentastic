CHANGE LOG!!!
*************

v0.1.0
------
Initial release!

known bugs:
1) Links appear all on the same line, for some reason.

v0.2.1
------
changes:
--All links now have exactly one line break after them.
--Added parantheticals. par>> activates.
--general maintainence stuffs
--started adding infrastructure for future features.

known bugs:
--text starts immediately at the top of the #page element, and looks ugly. DE-UGLIFY!


v0.2.7
------
Changes:
--Formatted the #page element to look like an 8.5x11 page!
--Added fun little 3 hole punches on the left side!

known bugs:
--The Three hole punch uses a unicode character, which does not exist in either Courier Prime or Twine. Need to change to something that renders properly or fix it so that it does.
--There's no error catching for when a passage extends beyond the #page element. Need to add either a scroll bar in the page or seperate out pages. Scroll bar is the lazy fix, multiple page fix is the smart option (smart for printing later).

v0.2.8
------
Changes:
--Added a menu! There's nothing in it yet, but it exists! Woo!
	--Planned items for menu: Quicksave/load, save to PDF, print. (others, too? There's plenty of room...)

Known bugs: 
--Dropping the menu and simultaneously dropping the #page div destroys the passage data. Gotta find out why... For now, the menu just covers the passage.
--Passage text shows through the window... it should go under (fix with z-index).
--Same bugs from last time.

v0.2.9/a/b/c
------------
Changes:
--Added the icons for the menu. They don't work right now and all they do is throw up an alert, telling you that the functionality's not in yet.
--Fixed the spacing on scene headers.
--Fixed the hole punches. They display correctly in the Twine player now.

Known bugs:
-- Still no fix for the text breaking the bottom of the page. For now, just make extra passages as a workaround. I hope to have this fixed for 0.3.0.
--I need to do something about those massive menu icons. They hurt to look at right now.

Thoughts:
--I should put in visual themes. That'd be fun. As long as what's on the page isn't changed, we can do whatever!
--base64 is wonderful.
