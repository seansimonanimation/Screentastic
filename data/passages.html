act&gt;&gt; A classroom full of exhausted College Senior Level TIME CADETS sit in their classroom, staring down their PROFESSOR, Mid-30s, wearing a tweed jacket with elbow patches and a bow tie wrap up her lecture.
act&gt;&gt;One student, CHRIS JENKINS, early twenties, wearing his green hoodie with “DR LORDE’S SCHOOL OF TEMPORAL MECHANICS” printed on the front, sits at his desk with his laptop in front, taking notes. Next to Chris, KATHLEEN MASON, mid-20s, skinny as a rail, hair disheveled, wearing the exact same hoodie as Chris, and black makeup, sits completely disinterested. She shakes her head in an attempt to wake herself up.
act&gt;&gt;The professor points her laser pointer to drawings on a whiteboard, demonstrating what she’s saying.
cha&gt;&gt; PROFESSOR
dia&gt;&gt; So to summarize the Bootstrap Paradox... You go back in time to meet your hero Abraham Lincoln because you love the Ghettysburg Address just so much.
act&gt;&gt; She moves the pointer to a terrible drawing of Abraham Lincoln, lying in a hammock, relaxing.
act&gt;&gt;She moves the pointer to a third drawing of someone handing a paper to Lincoln.
cha&gt;&gt;professor (cont&#x27;d)
dia&gt;&gt;so you, the time traveler freak out and hand him the address. He delivers. What is the paradox? Chris.
act&gt;&gt;She points to Chris. Chris stands up.
cha&gt;&gt;Chris
dia&gt;&gt;Who wrote the Ghettysburg address?
act&gt;&gt;The prfessor puts her laser pointer in her jacket pocket.
cha&gt;&gt;Professor
dia&gt;&gt;Exactly. Which came first, the chicken or the egg? The ghettysburg address or the time traveler?
act&gt;&gt;The professor checks her watch.
cha&gt;&gt;Professor (cont&#x27;d)
dia&gt;&gt;Class is dismissed. Next class, I want a page on how you can avoid runing all of time and space with this little gem.
act&gt;&gt; The TIME CADETS stand and suffle out of the classroom. Chris and Kathleen follow.
cha&gt;&gt;Professor (cont&#x27;d)
par&gt;&gt;(yelling)
dia&gt;&gt;And don&#x27;t forget, stay out of history!
