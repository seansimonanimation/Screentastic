The time, 5pm.  We see a rundown house in a bad neighborhood.  
Carlos is packing himself a lunch in his backpack in the kitchen.
He walks over to his parents who are playing poker with their friends.
Carlos asks his mom and dad if they can give him a ride to a late night school trip to the museum.
His dad claims that the car is still in the shop and that Carlos could use some exercise (says this with chips in his mouth).
As Carlos ties his shoes at the front door, he can hear his parents talk about him. “Stupid boy is too needy that’s what he is. Don’t know why we even had him.”  His mom replies, “We needed someone to take care of the laundry. That’s what adoption is isn’t it? Free manual labor.”  They all start to laugh.
Carlos walks out the door. We see his dad’s car in the garage.
Carlos arrives at the museum but arrives too late.  
We see everyone from class leaving the building and heading home with their friends and family.
To make matters worse, thunder breaks loose and begins to rain on him.
He heads underneath the museum’s gate entrance to take shelter.  
He decides to have the sandwich he packed.
A stray dog walks over him staring hungrily at Carlos’ meal.
Carlos takes pity and shares a small piece of his sandwich.
The dog instead takes a bite into his larger portion and runs off into the museum.
Carlos chases after it.
A pair of hollow eyes watches from the distance.
Carlos looses the dog and decides to leave.
The door gate doesn’t open trapping Carlos inside the museum. 
Carlos tries to find security to help let him back outside.
As he walks through the halls past the art displays, playful shadows shaped like wolves begin to follow Carlos from behind.
Carlos comes across a display featuring Native American relics.  
Carlos notices one of the pieces missing from the shelf.
He walks up to it and hears a crack sound from his feet.
He looks down and realizes he stepped on the missing display.
The shadows from early lurk in from behind with out Carlos noticing.
Carlos picks up have a piece of a coin with a dragonfly on it.
Two of the shadows give a playful smile to one another and begin to run around in a circle around Carlos while he’s not looking.
Carlos begins to hear security near by.  He worries that he’ll be blamed from damaging museum property. 
Carlos tries to make a run for it but his feet begin to sink.  The floor starts to dissolve into sand engulfing Carlos in. 
He manages to pull himself out, but then notices he is no longer in the museum. Instead he is in a small wasteland near the ocean. 
Carlos is surrounded by shadows causing him to freak out in fear.
[[go to next page|secondPage]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2" name="secondPage" tags="" position="704,279">They then stop and clear a path for their master to step forward.  It is coyote spirit towering over Carlos.
Carlos flips out saying “What’s are wolves doing in the city!?”
The coyote snarls and is annoyed.  She transforms into a young, girl close to Carlos’ age.  She walks up to him and analyzes him.
She asks to herself, “How did a human doing in the Wasteland?””
She turns her head toward her pack making whistle noises and smirks to act innocent.  “Figures.” she says. 
Carlos asks, “Excuse me, wolf-lady. Hi, big question. What’s going on?”
“Since you’re new, let me educate. One, I’m a coyote, not a wolf. There’s a difference. And two, my name is Rein. Three, you’re in the Wasteland of the Spirits. And four, you smell like pancakes and tuna-milk.”
Carlos: “What does that last part have to do with-” Rein drops him.
Rein then asks what he has in his hands.
Carlos shows her and sees the broken talisman. Rein asks what he did with the other half. Carlos tells him he found it like this and it’s broken.
She turns to her minions and demands a confession to whoever took the other half to come forward. 
Rein explains that her pack can be difficult to tame. And that they enjoy messing around in the human realm at night. They love taking stuff and burring in the woods. (Even though there suppose to give anything they take and give it for her to have.)
The talisman he has is a key that can take anyone between the human and spirit realm. But he needs the other fragment to get back.
Carlos asks for her to take him to the woods. Rein refuses saying it’s not her concern.  
Carlos lists everything that’s gone wrong to him today, and points that it was her stupid pets fault that he got into this and that she needs to own up.
Rein roles her eyes and submits to being his guide.  
Carlos then asks if he can ride her, but Rein says no. 
They walk on foot till they reach a dead tree forest.
Carlos is a bit uncomfortable not being familiar with his new surrounding.
Rein tells him to man up and that life always has new twists and turns that have trouble adjusting. She takes Carlos himself as an example for crashing her turf and had plans on taking a break from taking care of her pets. 
Carlos then asks why she puts up with those little shadows that keep trolling her.
Rein explains that they maybe hard to control, but they’re like family to her.
Rein picks up a scent, which leads to a giant hollow tree.
Inside is a load of garbage from the human world.
Carlos tries digging through to find it. Rein tells him that it’s going to take a century at his pace.
Suddenly, a worm-like tale grabs Rein and pulls her in.  Emerging from the trash is a giant opossum monster with Rein in coiled in its tail. Carlos stutters in fear.
The opossum accuses Rein of defiling his home.
Carlos steps in and says that they’ll clean the mess up.
The opossum agrees. Rein gives a sour annoyed look at Carlos saying that she hates cleaning. 
Rein and Carlos help dispose of all the garbage, but Carlos hasn’t managed to find the other fragment.
The opossum then grabs Carlos and takes away his fragment. He decides that Rein can leave, but not him.  
The opossum compliments on Carlos’ service and could use a human servant for tiding up. And when he gets old he’ll eat his remains and use his bones keep on working.
Infuriated, Rein’s aura grows around her taking the form of a giant coyote. She proceeds to bite the opossum by the tail and trash him like a chew toy till it dissolves into moss.
Rein criticizes to Carlos that this is what happens when you don’t say no to others. They take advantage of you.
Carlos apologies saying that he’s never been used to others helping him in return so much.  
Rein then hugs Carlos and comforts him.  She puts in his hand the other fragment he needs.
Rein then heads back to her turf and wishes him for the best of luck before he leaves. 
After Rein vanishes, Carlos takes a deep quiet pause. 
[[Go to next page|thirdPage]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="3" name="thirdPage" tags="" position="867,284">He is now back home outside the museum. 
Carlos looks into his hand and sees the talisman has been reassembled. 
He returns home and finds his foster parents watching TV.  They don’t seem to have notice how long he’s been absent.  Carlos heads up to his room sitting on his bed.  
His mom yells at Carlos and tells him to fix the antenna on the roof.  Carlos ignores her.
He pulls out the talisman from the museum and pauses for a moment.
Back in the spirit realm, Rein is disciplining her minions.
Rein picks up on a familiar sent.  She turns and finds Carlos standing in front of her. 
Rein asks why has he returned?
Carlos tells her that he realizes that he’s found his true home and has decided that he wants remain in the spirit realm.  
Rein jokes and comments that what he’s doing is really selfish which Carlos replies with a simple “yup.”
The End.
